# Rollup

Demo TypeScript compiled via watch scripts using [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#watch) or [tsc](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html)...
with type checking running when compiling!

No need to worry just relax and enjoy the magic configuration. It just works.

## Installation

```bash
yarn install
```

## Usage

```bash
# watch and build with rollup to ./dist-rollup

# watch and build with tsc to ./dist-tsc
yarn watch
```
